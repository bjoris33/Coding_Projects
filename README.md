# Coding_Projects

# Purpose of Repository
This repository was created to house miscellaneous scripts that I have written during my PhD. I will try to comment the best I can, but the majority of the tools will not be developed with generalizability in mind.

# Table of Contents
general_functions.Rmd - a document for command line functions used to call tools on the server or locally (read the manuals for more information)
## R_scripts
* pca_sep_loop.R - a script for separating features based on the PCA values
* tax_collapse.R - a script for taking all the rows for a unique taxonomic assignment in a count table and collapsing them into a single row
